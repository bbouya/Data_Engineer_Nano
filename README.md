## What is a data model?
 "... an abstraction that organizes elements of data and how they will relate to each other"
 "the process of creating data models for an information system"
 Data modeling can easily translate to database modeling, as this is the essential end state.
 
## Exemple of busines process

 - Process to support business and user applications 
 - Gather Requirements 
 - Conceptual Data Modeling 
 - Logical Data Modeling
 - Physical Data Modeling

# Data Modeling:
Pysical Data modeling to creal DDL in Relational and non-Relational Databases
Begin prior to building out application, Bisiness logic, and analytical Models.

Data modeling is an important skill for; 
 - Data scinetist
 - Software Enginner,
 - Data engineer 

# Relational and Non relational Database:
1. Relational Model :
  "This model organizes Data into one or more table (or 'Relations') of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Genrally, each table Represents one 'entity type'

The basics : 
   Database/Schema : Collection of Table
   Table/Relation : A group of Rows sharing the same labeled elements.
   
   
2.Non Relational Model : 
   Large Amounts of data
   need to be able to store different data type formats
   need hight throughput -- Fast Reads
   Need a flexible Schema 
   Need high Availability
   Need horizontal scalability

# Advantages of using a Realtional DataBase
 - Ease fo use SQL
 - Ability to do joins
 - ability to do Aggregation ans analytics 
 - Smaller DATA VOLUMES
 - Easier to change busines requirement 
 - Flexiblity for Queries 
 - Modeling the data not modeling
 - Secondary indexes Available
 - ACID Transactions -- DATA integrity

# What is PostGreSQL:
  1. Open source object-Relational database system
  2. Uses and builds on SQL langage
