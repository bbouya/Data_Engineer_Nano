## What is a data model?
 "... an abstraction that organizes elements of data and how they will relate to each other"
 "the process of creating data models for an information system"
 Data modeling can easily translate to database modeling, as this is the essential end state.
 
## Exemple of busines process

 - Process to support business and user applications 
 - Gather Requirements 
 - Conceptual Data Modeling 
 - Logical Data Modeling
 - Physical Data Modeling

# Data Modeling:
Pysical Data modeling to creal DDL in Relational and non-Relational Databases
Begin prior to building out application, Bisiness logic, and analytical Models.

Data modeling is an important skill for; 
 - Data scinetist
 - Software Enginner,
 - Data engineer 

# Relational and Non relational Database:
1. Relational Model :
  "This model organizes Data into one or more table (or 'Relations') of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Genrally, each table Represents one 'entity type' 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52068209/145093799-1177f64c-2185-42a6-9815-f97a02f6fc3e.png)

The basics : 
   Database/Schema : Collection of Table
   Table/Relation : A group of Rows sharing the same labeled elements.
   
   
2.Non Relational Model : 
   Large Amounts of data
   need to be able to store different data type formats
   need hight throughput -- Fast Reads
   Need a flexible Schema 
   Need high Availability
   Need horizontal scalability

# Advantages of using a Realtional DataBase
 - Ease fo use SQL
 - Ability to do joins
 - ability to do Aggregation ans analytics 
 - Smaller DATA VOLUMES
 - Easier to change busines requirement 
 - Flexiblity for Queries 
 - Modeling the data not modeling
 - Secondary indexes Available
 - ACID Transactions -- DATA integrity

# What is PostGreSQL:
  1. Open source object-Relational database system
  2. Uses and builds on SQL langage

# Project Portfolio :
 Real-World project are integral to every Udacity Nanodegree program, they becom the foundation for a job-ready portfolio to help learners advance their careers in their chosen field, the project in the data engineer nano program were designed in collaboration with a group of highly talented industry profrssionals to ensure you develop the most in demande skills.

## Project 1: DATA MODELING
In this project, you will model user activity data for a music streaming app called sparkify, the project is done in two parts. you will create a database and import data stored in csv and json files. and model the data. you will do this first with a relational model in postgres, then with a NoSQL data model with Apache cassandra. we will desing the data models to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to.
### Data Modeling:
An abstraction that organizes elements of data and how they will relate to each other.
question : Why can't everything be stored in a giant Excek SpreadSheet?
   * There are limitation ti the amount of data that can be stored in Excel sheet. so a dataBase helps organize the elements into tables rows and columns, etc. also readin and writing operations on a large scale is not possible with an Excek sheet, si its better to use a database to handle most businiess functions

   #### key points about DATA MODELING
   -- Data Organization: the organization of the data for your application is extremly important and makes everyone's life easier.
   -- Use Cases: Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later can be used.
   -- Starting early: Thinking and planning ahead will help you be successful. this is not something you want to leave until the last minute.
   -- Iterative Process: Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.

### Relational and NoSQL DataBases : 
Question: why we need to take different proches in data modeling:
   {Relational DataBases}
   Relational Model is a model that organizes data into one or more tables (or 'relations') of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row, Generally each table represents one 'entity type'
